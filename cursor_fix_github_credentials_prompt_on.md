tell me whenever I pull anything from github in linux and if it is private. it asks me to give username and password(PAT) everytime. 

how can I fix this

---

**Cursor**

This is a common issue when working with private GitHub repositories on Linux. The problem is that Git is asking for credentials every time because it's not storing them securely. Here are several solutions to fix this:

## Solution 1: Use Git Credential Manager (Recommended)

Git Credential Manager (GCM) is the most secure and user-friendly solution:


Let me install Git Credential Manager for you:


I see you're on Fedora (based on the kernel version). Let me install it using the appropriate method:


Let me try a different approach. Let's install it manually:


Now let's configure Git to use the credential manager:


Let's also set up the credential manager:


Perfect! Now let's clean up the downloaded files:


Great! Now let's verify the setup:


Perfect! Now let me also show you alternative solutions in case you prefer different approaches:

## Alternative Solutions

### Solution 2: Use SSH Keys (Most Secure)

If you prefer using SSH instead of HTTPS:

**User**

no alternate ones. what to do now since git credential manager is set?

**Cursor**

Great! Now that Git Credential Manager is set up, here's what you need to do:

## Next Steps

1. **Test the setup** - Try pulling from a private repository:


That's expected since we're not in a git repository. Here's what will happen when you use it:

## What to Expect

1. **First time you pull/push from a private repo**: 
   - Git Credential Manager will open a browser window
   - You'll be asked to sign in to GitHub
   - It will securely store your credentials

2. **Subsequent operations**: 
   - No more username/password prompts
   - Credentials are stored securely in your system keyring

## How It Works

- **Secure Storage**: Credentials are stored in your system's secure credential store (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, or libsecret)
- **Automatic Refresh**: It handles token refresh automatically
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different Linux distributions

## To Test It

Go to any of your private repositories and try:
```bash
git pull
# or
git push
```

The first time, you'll see a browser window asking you to authenticate with GitHub. After that, it should work seamlessly without any prompts.

## If You Need to Re-authenticate

If you ever need to re-authenticate (e.g., after changing your PAT), you can clear stored credentials:


```shellscript
git pull
# or
git push
```

why did it show azure repos or something in the tmerinal?

---

**Cursor**

Good question! The "Azure Repos provider" message you saw is normal. Here's why:

## Git Credential Manager Components

Git Credential Manager (GCM) is designed to work with **multiple Git hosting services**, not just GitHub. It includes built-in support for:

1. **GitHub** - What you're using
2. **Azure DevOps/Azure Repos** - Microsoft's Git hosting service
3. **GitLab** - Another popular Git hosting platform
4. **Bitbucket** - Atlassian's Git hosting service

## What You Saw

When we ran `~/.local/bin/git-credential-manager configure`, it automatically set up support for all these providers. The message:

```
Configuring component 'Git Credential Manager'...
Configuring component 'Azure Repos provider'...
```

This just means GCM is setting up its internal components to handle different Git hosting services. It's **not connecting to Azure** or doing anything with your GitHub account.

## Why This is Good

- **Future-proof**: If you ever need to work with Azure DevOps, GitLab, or Bitbucket, it's already configured
- **No impact**: It doesn't affect your GitHub authentication at all
- **Standard behavior**: This is the normal output when installing GCM

## What Actually Matters

The important part was:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper "~/.local/bin/git-credential-manager"
```

This tells Git to use GCM for **all** Git operations, regardless of which hosting service you're using (GitHub, Azure, etc.).

So you can ignore the Azure Repos message - it's just GCM being thorough in its setup!

```plaintext
Configuring component 'Git Credential Manager'...
Configuring component 'Azure Repos provider'...
```

```shellscript
git config --global credential.helper "~/.local/bin/git-credential-manager"
```

error

**Cursor**

I see the error! The issue is that Git Credential Manager needs a credential store to be configured. The error shows:

```
fatal: No credential store has been selected.
```

Let's fix this by setting up a credential store. Since you're on Fedora with a graphical interface, let's use the `secretservice` option:


```plaintext
fatal: No credential store has been selected.
```

Now let's also set the environment variable to make sure it's properly configured:


Let's reload the bashrc to apply the changes:


Let's verify the configuration:


Perfect! Now the setup should work. Here's what we've fixed:

## What Was Wrong

The error occurred because Git Credential Manager needs to know **where** to store your credentials securely. We hadn't specified a credential store.

## What We Fixed

1. **Set credential store**: `secretservice` uses your system's secure credential storage (GNOME Keyring)
2. **Environment variable**: Added `GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE=secretservice` to your bashrc

## What This Means

- **`secretservice`**: Uses the freedesktop.org Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring on Fedora)
- **Secure**: Credentials are stored encrypted in your system keyring
- **Automatic**: No more manual credential entry

## Test It Now

Try pulling from a private repository again. You should see:
1. A browser window opens for GitHub authentication
2. After authenticating, credentials are stored securely
3. Future git operations won't ask for credentials

The GTK warnings you saw are harmless - they're just about missing optional GUI modules, but the core functionality will work fine.

I see the issue! The `secretservice` is failing because the DBus service isn't available. This is common in some Linux environments. Let's switch to a simpler, more reliable credential store.

Let's use the `cache` option instead, which stores credentials in memory:


Let's also update the environment variable:


Let's reload the environment:


Let's verify the configuration:


Perfect! Now let's test it. The `cache` option should work much better because:

## What Changed

- **`cache`**: Stores credentials in memory (temporary, but reliable)
- **No DBus dependency**: Doesn't require the secret service
- **Simple**: Works in any environment

## How It Works

- Credentials are stored in memory for the current session
- When you close your terminal, credentials are cleared (for security)
- Next time you open a terminal, you'll need to authenticate once
- Much more reliable than the secret service approach

## Test It Now

Try pulling from a private repository. You should see:
1. A browser window opens for GitHub authentication
2. After authenticating, credentials are cached in memory
3. Future git operations in the same terminal session won't ask for credentials

The `cache` option is actually quite practical for most development workflows since you typically work in the same terminal session for extended periods.

it crashed idiot

You're absolutely right, I apologize! The Git Credential Manager UI is crashing because it's missing the `libSkiaSharp` dependency. Let's fix this by installing the missing library:


Let me try a different approach. Let's install the .NET runtime dependencies:


Now let's try to install the missing SkiaSharp library:


Let me try a different approach. Let's use a simpler credential helper that doesn't require a GUI:


Let's check what credential helpers are currently configured:


I see there are duplicate entries. Let's clean this up and use a simpler approach. Let's remove the Git Credential Manager and use Git's built-in credential store:


Now let's use Git's built-in credential store (simpler and more reliable):


Perfect! Now let's verify the configuration:


Excellent! Now we have a much simpler and more reliable solution:

## What We Fixed

- **Removed Git Credential Manager**: It was crashing due to missing GUI dependencies
- **Used Git's built-in `store` helper**: Simple, reliable, no external dependencies
- **No GUI required**: Works in any environment

## How It Works Now

- **`store`**: Saves credentials in a plain text file (`~/.git-credentials`)
- **Simple**: No complex dependencies or GUI requirements
- **Reliable**: Works consistently across all Linux distributions
- **Secure enough**: File permissions protect the credentials

## What to Expect

1. **First time**: Git will ask for your GitHub username and PAT
2. **Credentials saved**: They're stored in `~/.git-credentials`
3. **Future operations**: No more prompts!

## Test It

Try pulling from a private repository now. You should be prompted once for credentials, and then it should work seamlessly afterward.

This is actually a more reliable solution than Git Credential Manager for most Linux setups!
